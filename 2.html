<p>papa, when you feel so bad<br>
just turn around from the ages that passed away</strong><br>
mama's cookies are always on the table<br>
we'll feel much better, after just a bite<br>
<p>I was always so alone and young<br>
now I am grown but the same, I’ve got no one</p>
I could use my eyes to make some friends<br>
but I always wanted to come home to my family<br>
baby, my love, my butterflies<br>
I’m your friend, I’m your world’s best hugger<br>
remember <strong>I’ll always say <u>good night</u> to you</strong></p>
