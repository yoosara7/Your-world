<img src="color.jpg" width="40%">
<p>All the colors and personalities<br>
<strong>you can’t see right through <u>what I truly am</u></strong><br>
you’re hurting me without noticing<br>
I’m so, so broke like someone just robbed me<br>
I’m no invincible I have much memories of getting more weaker<br>
I know I’m not loveable but you know what you’d have to say</p>
<p>“Come on let’s go to bed we gonna rock the night away<br>
who did that to you, babe<br>
If you’re not in the right mood to sleep now then, <br>
Come on, let’s drink and have very unmanageable day<br>
would you want me in bae<br>
If you’re not in the right mood to sleep now then<br>
come take my arms and go I’II be yours for sure”</p>
