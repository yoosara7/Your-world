  BUBBLES & MUSHROOMS</a> for you</p>

<p>bubbles and mushrooms<br>
I'm not sipping them two both at the same time<br>
just thinking of you and last week with you<br>
how our lives are so crazy, got crazier<br>
you gave a shit, I gave my heart<br>
it's the only difference between us</p>
<p>love gave me heaven, you give me hell<br>
love has been disappeared in your heart<br>
<strong>love is all <u>bubbles</u></strong><br>
bubbles are made of<br>
dreams are all bubbles<br>
bubbles are made of<br>
love is all bubbles<br>
I made them with you</p>
